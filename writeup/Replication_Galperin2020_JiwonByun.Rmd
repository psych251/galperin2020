## Introduction

Employers' selection of job applicants is an important labor market proesses for both employers and individuals. For organizations, access to high-quality workers is a source of competitive advantage. For individuals, access to certain jobs at certain timing can have a large impact on one's career trajectories. Job signaling is the most fundamental and important aspect of selection processes in labor market. Information asymmetries between employers and job applicants provide challenges for both ends.
Most studies have focused on job signaling and applicant capabilities when trying to understand selection processes in labor markets. On the other hand, increasing number of studies suggest that selection decisions are affected not only by perceptions of applicantss' capability but also by perceptions of applicants' commitment to the organization.
While previous literature investigated both the effect of perceptions of applicants' capability and the effect of perceptions of applicants' commitment on the likelihood of a candidate's being selected for a job, the relationship between the two dimensions had been understudied. In an attempt to shed light on such a gap in the literature, Galperin, Hahl, Sterling, and Guo (Gelperin et al. henceforth) conducted a series of online field experiments and published an article in ASQ in the year of 2020. (For reference, see `Links` section in the below.)
Galperin et al. (2020) suggested that signals that influence perceptions of capability in labor markets may have discernable effects of the perceptions of a candidate's commitment, which also affects the likelihood of the candidate's being selected for the job. The paper included four studies, three of which were online field experiments. In this study, I plan to replicate Study 2. 


### Justification for choice of study

In the original paper, the authors conducted a direct test of the effect of applicants' commitment and high-capability rejection. Study 2 was conducted to directly manipulated perceived commitment of an applicant to complement one of the other studies where they could not directly manipulate commitment. This is important because the important contribution of the study is suggested (and proved) mediation effect of commitment on likelihood of a job offer.


### Anticipated challenges

I anticipate two challenges while attempting to replicate the results. First, I may run into sample issue. This study is about job signals and hiring managers' decision making in making job offers. Hence, it is important that I only have hiring managers (defined by someone with experiences as a hiring manager) in the sample. Since I have to rely on Qualtrics to do the sampling, less appropriate sample might acquired at the end. Similar issue applies to random assignment of participants. Second, survey design might be difficult. The main part of this replication study is manipulating commitment of a job applicant. Since commitment could mean different things both conceptually and practically, it is essential that I manipulate the main concepts elaborately. To overcome this challenge, I plan to reach out to original authors and try to acquire survey items that they used for the original study.
